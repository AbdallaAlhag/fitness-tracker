# Fitness-Tracker (Fibit, Strava, and Hevy compiled data)  
Fitness tracker since the fitbit app doesn't sync with strava or hevy. The only stat it adds with the apple health app is steps walk and I can't quite seem to get it to sync properly.  
For now, the Health app can sync with Hevy and strava while fitbit just records my nutrition which is alright but I decided to strap it into one application.  
The Apple Health App to fitbit sync apps on the app store are incredibly terrible and It would cost me $100 for an apple developer subscription to deploy my app and I need a mac os to use xcode to create it which would cost my around $100 a month to lease a cloud mac os to write the code.  
So i'm just going to fetch the data from fitbit, strava, and hevy myself and write my own little compiled display. Since I don't have access to Health App, i'll have to ignore that data but it didn't provide much besides sync with strava and hevy automatically.
